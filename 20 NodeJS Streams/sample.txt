Weather Bot using Google DialogFlow ES, 2024
The bot is designed to provide users with current and forecasted global weather information for specified cities. The forecast can extend up to 8 days from the current date. The bot
interacts with users through a conversational flow, retrieves
weather data via a REST API, and displays the information
within the Dialogflow chat interface with backend NodeJS and
Ngrok for webhook URL hosting.
IntelliCART, Final Year Project 2024
Employs AI and Deep Learning models for real-time freshness
assessment. The Flutter mobile app provides quality and pricing information, vendor locations via Google Maps API, and
customer feedback. Back-end services use FAST API, hosted

PROJECTS
Weather Bot using Google DialogFlow ES, 2024
The bot is designed to provide users with current and forecasted global weather information for specified cities. The forecast can extend up to 8 days from the current date. The bot
interacts with users through a conversational flow, retrieves
weather data via a REST API, and displays the information
within the Dialogflow chat interface with backend NodeJS and
Ngrok for webhook URL hosting.
IntelliCART, Final Year Project 2024
Employs AI and Deep Learning models for real-time freshness
assessment. The Flutter mobile app provides quality and pricing information, vendor locations via Google Maps API, and
customer feedback. Back-end services use FAST API, hosted
on Azure, with Firebase as the database. Additionally, government price validation ensures fair pricing. These technologies
together guarantee quality assurance, fair pricing, and easy
access to fresh produce.

Weather Bot using Google DialogFlow ES, 2024
The bot is designed to provide users with current and forecasted global weather information for specified cities. The forecast can extend up to 8 days from the current date. The bot
interacts with users through a conversational flow, retrieves
weather data via a REST API, and displays the information
within the Dialogflow chat interface with backend NodeJS and
Ngrok for webhook URL hosting.
IntelliCART, Final Year Project 2024
Employs AI and Deep Learning models for real-time freshness
assessment. The Flutter mobile app provides quality and pricing information, vendor locations via Google Maps API, and
customer feedback. Back-end services use FAST API, hosted
